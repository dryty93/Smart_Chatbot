Re: Medical Necessity Appeal for Patient John Doe

Dear Appeals Department,

I am writing on behalf of my patient, Mr. John Doe, to appeal the recent denial of coverage for a medically necessary MRI of the lumbar spine. The denial was issued on the grounds that the procedure was not deemed medically necessary. However, I respectfully disagree with this assessment and request a reconsideration of this decision.

Mr. Doe has been experiencing severe lower back pain for the past three months, accompanied by numbness in his left leg. Despite our best efforts at conservative treatment, his condition has not improved. The persistence of his pain, along with the onset of neurological symptoms, necessitates further diagnostic procedures to ensure appropriate treatment.

An MRI of the lumbar spine is the most accurate non-invasive method to diagnose the cause of his symptoms and to guide the subsequent course of treatment. Without this procedure, we are left with a partially treated condition, the cause of which remains unknown. This could potentially lead to worsening of his condition and possibly irreversible damage.

The clinical notes attached to this letter document Mr. Doe's ongoing symptoms, the treatments attempted, and their lack of success. They also provide evidence of the neurologic symptoms he is experiencing. These records clearly demonstrate the medical necessity of the requested MRI.

In light of this information, I kindly request that you reconsider the denial of coverage for Mr. Doe's lumbar spine MRI. I believe that this procedure is not only medically necessary but also crucial for his overall health and wellbeing.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require further information or clarification.

Sincerely,

Dr. Susan Lee

Re: Appeal for Maria Perez
Policy Number: [Policy Number]
Service/Procedure: Genetic testing for BRCA1/BRCA2

Dear Appeals Committee,

I am writing on behalf of my patient, Maria Perez, to formally appeal the denial for coverage of the genetic testing for BRCA1/BRCA2. This appeal is in response to your denial letter stating the reason for the denial as an experimental/investigational procedure.

I respectfully disagree with your assessment. The genetic testing for BRCA1/BRCA2 is not an experimental procedure but a medically necessary one based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Maria has a strong family history of breast cancer, which makes her a high-risk patient for developing breast cancer herself. The genetic testing was recommended to assess her risk and devise an appropriate preventive strategy.

Moreover, prior to the procedure, verbal authorization was obtained from a representative of Aetna. This implies that there was an understanding of the medical necessity of this procedure for Maria.

The denial of coverage for this procedure could potentially hinder the preventive care and early detection strategy for Maria, which could have serious health implications. I urge you to consider the medical necessity of this procedure based on Maria's high-risk status and the NCCN guidelines.

I trust that you will reconsider your decision and approve the coverage for the BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing for Maria Perez. I am willing to provide additional documentation or discuss this case further if needed.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your positive response before the appeal deadline of June 18, 2024.

Sincerely,

Dr. Alan Chan

Michael O'Connor,Blue Cross Blue Shield,Service not covered under plan,Physical therapy (12 sessions),Dr. Emily Wallace,Therapy ordered post knee surgery. Miscommunication about plan tier. Benefits summary suggests coverage for medically necessary PT.,2024-06-10,"[Letter Body]

Dear Claims Review Department,

I am writing on behalf of my patient, Mr. Michael O'Connor, to formally appeal the denial of coverage for medically necessary physical therapy sessions. The denial, as per your explanation, was due to the service not being covered under Mr. O'Connor's current insurance plan.

Mr. O'Connor underwent knee surgery, after which I, as his primary care provider, ordered a course of physical therapy to aid in his recovery. The therapy is not an elective or optional treatment, but a crucial part of his post-operative care, which is essential to restore his mobility and prevent potential complications such as stiffness, pain, and loss of function in the affected knee. 

I understand that there may have been a miscommunication about the tier of Mr. O'Connor's plan. However, upon reviewing the benefits summary of his insurance policy, it suggests coverage for medically necessary physical therapy. Given this, and the necessity of the therapy for Mr. O'Connor's recovery, I respectfully request a reconsideration of the decision to deny coverage for this service.

I am enclosing a copy of the benefits summary and the clinical notes related to Mr. O'Connor's surgery and subsequent need for physical therapy. I trust these documents will provide sufficient evidence for the medical necessity of the physical therapy sessions in question.

I kindly request this appeal to be processed well before the appeal deadline on June 10, 2024, to avoid any delay in Mr. O'Connor's treatment plan. I believe in the commitment of Blue Cross Blue Shield to provide its members with the necessary medical coverage and trust that you will consider this appeal favorably.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information or clarification.

Sincerely,

Dr. Emily Wallace"

Re: Medical Insurance Appeal for Patient: Aisha Grant

Dear Claims Review Department,

I am writing on behalf of our patient, Aisha Grant, to formally appeal the denial of coverage for a CT scan of the abdomen. This procedure was performed under the care of Dr. Marcus Riley and was medically necessary due to a suspected case of appendicitis. 

The denial of this claim was based on the grounds of incomplete documentation. However, I would like to clarify that this was due to a fax error which led to the omission of the ER notes from the initial claim. We acknowledge this error and have since rectified it. The complete and comprehensive records, including the ER notes, are now available for review.

The CT scan was crucial in diagnosing and treating Aisha's condition in a timely manner. As you are aware, appendicitis is a serious medical condition that requires immediate attention to prevent further complications such as rupture and peritonitis. Delaying or denying the necessary diagnostic procedure could put the patient's life at risk.

We respectfully request that you review this appeal before the appeal deadline on June 13, 2024, taking into account the complete documentation now available. We believe that with the full context, you will find the CT scan to be medically necessary and appropriate for the situation at hand.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to your positive response in this matter. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require additional information or documentation.

Sincerely,

Dr. Marcus Riley"

Re: David Kim
Policy Number: [Policy Number]
Claim Number: [Claim Number]

Dear Appeals Committee,

I am writing on behalf of my patient, David Kim, to appeal the denial of coverage for a medically necessary sleep study (Polysomnography) that was performed recently. The denial was based on the grounds that prior authorization was not obtained.

As you may already know, Mr. Kim has been displaying classic symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. Due to the urgency of his situation, particularly considering the occupational risks associated with his condition, it was medically necessary to proceed with the sleep study without delay. We understand the importance of obtaining prior authorization and have submitted a retroactive authorization request to rectify the situation.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a serious condition that can lead to a wide range of health complications if left untreated. The sleep study was crucial in diagnosing Mr. Kim's condition and planning an appropriate treatment strategy. Delaying the study would not only have compromised his health but also potentially put his safety at risk, given the nature of his occupation.

We trust that you understand the seriousness of Mr. Kim's condition and the necessity for the immediate sleep study. We are confident that upon review, you will find the procedure to be medically necessary and will reconsider the denial of coverage.

We have attached the necessary clinical notes and documentation to support this appeal. If you require any additional information, please feel free to contact our office.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to your prompt response, given the appeal deadline of June 17, 2024. 

Sincerely,

Dr. Naomi Brooks
